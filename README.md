# project_report_time

 volunteered in an NPO, and created a system of shift reports, in which
volunteers who work with children feed their work hours, and the
parents confirm via email. The system enables the managers of the NPO
to easily keep track of the activity with the children, and avoid manual
updates, which they formerly did. visit repository
